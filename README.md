<h1>Pystatusupdater</h1>
<p>Pystatusupdater is a basic tool for sharing system info over email or Discord webhook at a set interval, allowing for the user to keep track of their system status.</p>

<h1>How to use? (you shouldn't)</h1>
<p>My code is really bad so preferably don't use this, but if you want to:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>clone repo</li>
  <li>copy config.sample.yml to config.yml and adjust the settings to fit your needs</li>
  <li>install all required python libraries listed in requirements.txt</li>
  <li>hopefully it works (you'll have to probably disable some options that don't work right lol)</li>
</ol>

<h1>Bugs + issues</h1>
<p>I've tested this on Windows, Linux and macOS. This program should work on all of them. (might require some tweaks in config.yml for some OSes)</p>
<p>If you want to report a bug, preferably fix it yourself and make a pull request (I'm too lazy to update this, as long as it works for me, idrc lol)</p>
